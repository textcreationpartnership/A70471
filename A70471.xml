         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen the dark night of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øions was by Gods wonderful mercy, (never to be forgotten) well nigh at an end, by the near approaching of our Sun, the breath of our no≈øtrils, our dread Soveraign Lord the Kings Maje≈øty, unto the horizon of his paenitent and loyal Subjects in his hereditary Kingdomes and Dominions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb facs="tcp:93080:3"/>all began to be revived, &amp; to be prepared for the receiving all good impre≈ø≈øions: in this beginning of our happine≈øs, (con≈øidering with my ≈øelf by what be≈øt means men of different apprehen≈øions concerning Eccle≈øia≈øtical things might be brought unto godly unity and meet uniformity therein;) I thought that the knowledge of the ≈øtate of the Church of Chri≈øt in the Apo≈øtles dayes, and in the four Centuries following their times, (as to the form of Eccle≈øia≈øtical Government, Di≈øcipline, Liturgy and Rites, u≈øed in them) would very much conduce to the attainment of that ble≈ø≈øed end. For in tho≈øe dayes many thou≈øands of holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øors and Martyrs flouri≈øhed; in tho≈øe times lived the mo≈øt reverend Fathers of the fir≈øt four general Councils, of <hi>Nice, Con≈øtantinople, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe≈øus</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> celebrated over all the Chri≈øtian world; of who≈øe wi≈ødome and godly care, to do nothing in tho≈øe particulars again≈øt the in≈øtitutions of Chri≈øt and his Apo≈øtles, but rather to do all things as might be mo≈øt plea≈øing to God, and mo≈øt conducing to the edification of the Church, no prudent and charitable man can enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the lea≈øt doubt: Men they were, and might erre; but that ≈øo many men of extraordinary ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line≈ø≈øe and wi≈ødome, compared to the be≈øt men of the≈øe latter Centuries, ≈øhould unanimou≈øly agree
<pb facs="tcp:93080:3"/>for the ≈øpace of two, three or four hundred years in ≈øetting up and practi≈øing ≈øuper≈øtition, is incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible to them who believe that God hath promi≈øed to teach the humble his way, and ≈øhew his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to them that fear him, and not to for≈øake them which have not fir≈øt for≈øaken him. Having therefore rea≈øon and religion to a≈ø≈øure me, that all under≈øtanding and ≈øober men, if they could once ≈øee the form of Church-government, with the Liturgies and Rites u≈øed by tho≈øe Primitive Churches, demon≈øtrated by undeniable te≈øtimonies of pure antiquity, would ea≈øily be induced to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace them ≈øo far as they ≈øhould appear to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for Chri≈øtian unity and edification, in the pre≈øent circum≈øtances of time, place, and per≈øons, (whereof not private men, but the Governours Civil and Eccle≈øia≈øtical are the onely Judges on earth) I made what inquiry I could, if any book were extant in the Engli≈øh tongue containing a brief, full, and plain demon≈øtration of all the ≈øaid Eccle≈øia≈øtical things, which might be had at a cheap rate, ≈øoon read over, and ea≈øily under≈øtood by all men of indifferent capacity, whereby the knowledge of tho≈øe things might be the more divulged: But, after diligent inquiry, finding none, I re≈øolved (being the work was within the limits of my vocation, and in reading
<pb facs="tcp:93080:4"/>the ancient writers, I had with no ≈ømall diligence noted the pa≈ø≈øages conducing thereto) <hi>invocato Dei Opt. Max. Nomine,</hi> to u≈øe my poor talent with my be≈øt indevour to write ≈øuch a little book, which ≈øhould comprehend in it the ≈øum and ≈øub≈øtance of all the matters above ≈øpecified, as briefly, fully and plainly as I could. And this was the beginning of this ≈ømall Treati≈øe; which, being ended in convenient time, was offered to worthy men of excellent indowments to be peru≈øed by them, in hope that one or other of them (knowing the u≈øefulne≈øs of the matter treated of, and ob≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the too plain, low, and uneven manner of writing) would be moved to put forth a work upon that ≈øubject; which (being repleni≈øhed with good variety of well ordered matters, adorned with convenient eloquence, and commended by the worthy name of an Author famous for his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, eloquence, and vertues) would be by all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily entertained, greedily read, and would ≈øweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convey the things de≈øired to be publi≈øhed, to the knowledge of all men. But herein my hope failed me: For tho≈øe worthy per≈øons were ≈øo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the high and weighty affaires of the Church, that they had no lei≈øure to go about this, (although an u≈øeful work, yet) of le≈øs profit to the Church and le≈øs proportionable to their great abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb facs="tcp:93080:4"/>then the ≈øublime imployment, wherein their time was ≈øpent. What remained then, but that either that needful work mu≈øt be altogether want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or this poor treati≈øe ≈øo void of due ornaments mu≈øt be ≈øuffred to go abroad. I had indeed once in a manner re≈øolved to bury it in my ≈øtudy, but an occa≈øion bringing the matterr into a new debate, I ≈øuffered ≈øome rea≈øons to prevaile with me to give it leave to pre≈øent it ≈øelf to the view of the world; yet not without ≈øome honourable Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron the glorious lu≈øtre of who≈øe great learning, Excellent Vertues and pretious name might both illumminate it, and conciliate for the mean and ob≈øcure author ≈øome room in the good esteem and affection of learned and good men.

            <p>THis ≈øhort treati≈øe containeth the ≈øum and ≈øub≈øtance of what the reverend Doctors of the Primitive Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches for the fir≈øt four hundred years after the birth of our ble≈ø≈øed Saviour have practi≈øed and written, and thereby tran≈ømitted to our times, concerning Epi≈øcopacy, Presbytery, Eccle≈øia≈øtical Di≈øcipline, Liturgy and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, omitting onely tho≈øe which appear to be impertinent to the ≈øtate and condition of the pre≈øent times. Every mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial point herein is proved out of authors received by all ≈øides (which cau≈øed the omi≈øsion of the te≈øtimony of <hi>Ignatius, &amp;c.</hi>) and ≈øuch authors again≈øt whom it cannot be rea≈øonably pre≈øumed, that they were deceived or erred in their relation of matters of fact and practi≈øe, done or u≈øed in the times, wherein they them≈øelves or tho≈øe with whom they conver≈øed, did live. The authorities were not collected by the help of tables, or received from ≈øecond hands (whence mi≈øtakes do ea≈øily and u≈øually ari≈øe) but were taken from the authors own work read and duely con≈øidered.

The Churches of this ≈øpace of time; that is, between the Apo≈øtles decea≈øe and the

And here by the way, concerning the Church of <hi>England,</hi> if we compare her in her legall con≈øtitution with any other Church after the year of our Lord <hi>180.</hi> it will be found that they who charge her with Antichri≈øtiani≈øme, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, or Super≈øtition in her con≈øtitution, e≈øtabli≈øhed by Law, do by clear con≈øequence pa≈øs the ≈øentence of the ≈øame condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation upon every of tho≈øe Churches, e≈øpecially them of the 4th and 5th century: the ra≈øhne≈øs and inju≈øtice of which cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure is very worthy of a very ≈øevere cen≈øure.

The my≈øtery of Iniquity was indeed in the Church in ≈øome dead branches, in ≈øome wicked livers and Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, but it was not of the Church, it was no part of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitution of the Church, although it did labour to in≈øinuate and work it ≈øelf into it: it may be granted as very probable, that the my≈øtery of iniquity in particular, and tho≈øe dead members, and by them working upon the Churches, might more vitiate the Churches of the ≈øecond century then the Churches in the fir≈øt century, and the Churches in the third century, more then the Churches of the ≈øecond and ≈øo of the re≈øt to the end of the fifth century; but that in any part of that time it prevailed ≈øo far, as to become a part of the Eccle≈øia≈øticall Doctrine, Di≈øcipline, Liturgy or Ceremonies univer≈øally received and u≈øed, is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a ≈øurmi≈øe of an exce≈øs of jealou≈øy, then an opinion ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon probable rea≈øons, it is ≈øo far from being an approved truth.

And therefore the≈øe latter Churches were not by the fir≈øt reformers of our Church propo≈øed, for patterns, as the former were, which pre≈øerved the purity of Doctrine, Di≈øcipline, and Ceremonies without the addition of any thing cau≈øing Super≈øtition, much le≈øs Idolatry or Haere≈øy.

            <p>But partly my de≈øire to contribute my poor mite towards the re≈øtauration of Gods Hou≈øe prevailed with me, partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the truth of that ≈øaying of <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> that the ≈øcience of preaching is in a manner Angelical, and whether it be exerci≈øed by the tongue or hand (writing) profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth either way, and knowing my ≈øelf to be not far from the time when the ≈øtrength of voyce may decrea≈øe, I thought it not ami≈øs to put it to the trial by this beginning; whether I might
<pb facs="tcp:93080:9"/>hereafter with any hope of acceptance and profit, attempt to recompence the defect which (if I live) may likely happen in my voyce, with the labour and pains of preaching by the pen. Some may think that I have made no good choi≈øe in preferring the judgment of St. <hi>Hierome</hi> a Pre≈øbyter, and not well affected, (as many think) to Epi≈øcopacy, before the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of <hi>Epiphanius</hi> a Bi≈øhop, and the elder of the two.<note place="margin">

His works do abundantly te≈øtify, that he bad in ≈øingular honour, both the one and the other: only he often reproveth, and that ≈øharply the Ambition, Covetuou≈øne≈øs, and other vices of many Bi≈øhops, which not he only, but others before him, and in his time, even Bi≈øhops them≈øelves did performe with no le≈øs ≈øharpne≈øs and ≈øeverity.

What? is this wi≈øe and holy Arch-Bi≈øhop for the abrogation of Epi≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy root and branch? no; no, he only taxeth the exorbitancy, the abu≈øe, the ambition, and not the holy function: he expounds him≈øelf, when in the ≈øame place he expre≈ø≈øeth the prelacy which he wi≈øheth outed, to be the Tyrannie of Authority, and prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence; it is that which cau≈øed many wife men to ≈øhun the function, becau≈øe in had company it is difficult to rule well, which at all times is the work of an excelling faculty,<note place="margin">Greg.

Secondly, <hi>Hierome</hi> was not inferiour in
<pb facs="tcp:93080:10"/>learning, eloquence and piety to any of the Ancients, neither did any excell him in the knowledg of the antiquities of the Church. And he, that doth not look very narrowly into the works of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> may find him defective in this la≈øt. <hi>Hierome's</hi> te≈øtimony concerning the originall of Epi≈øcopacy, although in formall expre≈ø≈øions it differs from <hi>Epiphanius</hi>'s, yet perhaps by the di≈øtinction of extraordinary and ordinary Epi≈øcopacy, the difference in words may be brought into an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in ≈øen≈øe; and if there be a difference in the ≈øen≈øe between them: Yet <hi>Hierome</hi> affords a more immediate, direct, and efficacious argument for Epi≈øcopacy and its contiruance then the other. I am much deceived, and have Cro≈øsed mine own re≈øolution, if I have not delivered the truth impartially, as I found it in the holy old Doctors.

Of Apo≈øtles ≈øome were primary, as the twelve, other ≈øecondary; and the≈øe were either indeed (as well as in name) A po≈øtles, or onely becau≈øe they were conver≈øant with the Apo≈øtles and their helpers, and many times left by them in ≈øome Churches, or ≈øent to them as their Vicegerents, ≈øuch were <hi>Timothy, Titus, Linus, Clemens, &amp;c.</hi> all the≈øe by their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtolical function, or by vertue of their Vicegerency, had the principal rule in the Churches wherein they abode, even then, when in all other Churches, the Colledge of the presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters took the care of all, having no Superior con≈øtantly re≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent over them.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93080:19"/>of an ordinary Epi≈øcopacy. Now, becau≈øe it was thought fit by the Apo≈øtles that <hi>James</hi> ≈øhould re≈øide at <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> (and that not long after the a≈øcen≈øion of our Saviour) it might truly be ≈øaid, that he was then ordained, that is, con≈øtituted Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhop (extraordinary) in that place for ≈øome particular rea≈øons taken from con≈øideration of ≈øome particular condition of that place, who≈øe Epi≈øcopacy afterward was continued for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rea≈øon of preventing Schi≈ømes; and con≈øequently of an extraordinary Epi≈øcopacy was made an ordinary Epi≈øcopacy, which was to pa≈øs to ≈øucce≈ø≈øors.

            <p>If the re≈øt of the Fathers be ≈øo under≈øtood (as it is not very improbable but that many of them may) the ≈øeeming diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between him and ≈øome of them may be perhaps in the main reconciled. <hi>Theodoret</hi> ≈øaith, that Bi≈øhops in the life time of the Apo≈øtles were called Apo≈øtles, the name of the extraordinary Bi≈øhops being al≈øo communicated to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Bi≈øhops, who al≈øo had ≈øome appearance of being Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents unto tho≈øe twelve general Pa≈øtors of the univer≈øal Church while they lived, as they were counted their ≈øucce≈ø≈øors after their decea≈øe.</p>
            <p>As to the other ≈øeeming contrariety in St. <hi>Hierom</hi>'s writings affirming the ordinary Epi≈øcopacy to be of Eccle≈øia≈øtical and humane in≈øtitution and al≈øo of Apo≈øtolical tradition, it is ea≈øily an≈øwered.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, That the ordinary Epi≈øcopacy is not a primary tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Apo≈øtles but of the Churches; to who≈øe decree the Apo≈øtolical approbation added no new ≈øanction, but ratified the authority of the Churches as prudently exerci≈øed in making that con≈øtitution.</p>

            <p>Secondly, that decree may be ≈øaid to be of Apo≈øtolical tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, becau≈øe their extraordinary Epi≈øcopacy and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Epi≈øcopacy of their Vicegerents e≈øtabli≈øhed by them, were patterns, which the Churches had an eye unto for their direction and encouragement in the framing of that decree; hoping that the good of peace, pre≈øerved where the extraordinary Epi≈øcopacy was placed, would be be≈øt main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in all Churches when the like government ≈øhould be ≈øetled in all to continue by ≈øucce≈ø≈øion.<note place="margin">3.</note> Thirdly, the ancient Fathers affirm many eccle≈øia≈øtical ob≈øervances to be of divine or Apo≈øtolical in≈øtitution or tradition, upon other grounds then may beget a certain belief of their being truely divine or Apo≈øtolical. <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> ≈øaith, that what≈øoever the univer≈øal Church holdeth, and is not found in following Councils con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtituted, but always retained, is mo≈øt rightly believed to be delivered by the Apo≈øtolick authority.<note place="margin">De bapt. contra Donati≈øt. l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>7.</hi> &amp; l. <hi>4.</hi> c. ult.</note>

            <p>Fourthly, it is a certain truth, acknowledged by all the learned, that the Apo≈øtles were authors as well of local and temporary or univer≈øal and temporary ordinances, rites, or ceremonies, as of univer≈øal and perpetual: for they were in≈øpired by the Holy Gho≈øt infallibly to di≈øcern both what the pre≈øent condition (although variable) of ≈øome or all the Churches required, and what upon rea≈øons ari≈øing from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variable grounds and circum≈øtances was needful to be ob≈øerved in all the Churches of Chri≈øt: <hi>Polycarpus</hi> (a hearer of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtles, and by St. <hi>John</hi> made Bi≈øhop of <hi>Smyrna</hi>) celebrated the Pa≈øche in the fourteenth moon, and ≈øo did the re≈øt of <hi>A≈øia</hi> and ≈øome of the <hi>Ea≈øt:</hi> ob≈øerving it the ≈øame time with the <hi>Jews,</hi> moved thereto by the countenance and example of St. <hi>John</hi> the Apo≈øtle; but <hi>Anicetus</hi> Bi≈øhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> (who flouri≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the life time of <hi>Polycarpus</hi>) and generally the Churches of the <hi>We≈øt;</hi> kept the Fea≈øt at another time, and on the Lords day, induced thereto as they affirmed by the tradition and example of St. <hi>Peter</hi> the Apo≈øtle. We cannot with rea≈øon and charity think that either <hi>Polycarpus</hi> with the <hi>A≈øians</hi> and <hi>Ea≈øt,</hi> or <hi>Anicetus</hi> with the <hi>We≈øtern</hi> Churches,<note place="margin">Apud Eu≈øeb. &amp; Iren.</note> could be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the time when <hi>Peter</hi> in the <hi>We≈øt</hi> or <hi>John</hi> in <hi>A≈øia</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved that Fea≈øt, <hi>Polycarpus</hi> being an eye witne≈øs of what the Apo≈øtle St. <hi>John</hi> did, and <hi>Anicetus</hi> being a hearer of the hearers of <hi>Clemens,</hi> who was contemporary with the Apo≈øtle
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93080:21"/>St. <hi>Peter;</hi> or that they would con≈øiderately ≈øpeak, and per≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veringly maintain an untruth, imputing a fact to either Apo≈øtle which he had not done, e≈øpecially, ≈øeeing the untruth, on either ≈øide, might have been confuted by a thou≈øand witne≈ø≈øes: wherefore we mu≈øt judge this to be an evident example of a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable apo≈øtolick in≈øtitution. I might in≈øtance in part of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtles decree in the 15 chapter of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apo≈øtles, of things ≈øtrangled, and blood; but lea≈øt I move ≈øcruples in weak con≈øciences, which they cannot ea≈øily be rid of, I will only commend to the con≈øideration of the judicious the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ≈øome ancient writers quoted in the margent.<note place="margin">Augu≈øt contra Fau≈øtum l. <hi>32.</hi> c. <hi>13.</hi> Et tract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti contra grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos in biblioth. patr. to <hi>4.</hi> pag. <hi>1308.</hi> et <hi>1318.1319.1320.</hi>
               </note> There be many rites which the Fathers held to be Apo≈øtolical, which in the times of the ≈øame Fathers, were in many places altered or neglected; as the three immer≈øions in bapti≈øme; the repairing of neighbour Bi≈øhops to the people where a Bi≈øhop was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, there to ordain one in the pre≈øence of the people; not to fa≈øt in the dayes of Penteco≈øt, and ≈øome other; which prove that according to the judgment of tho≈øe Fathers, the Apo≈øtles, (guided by divine in≈øpiration) made ≈øome decrees alterable, and which were upon ju≈øt rea≈øons accordingly changed or di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>u≈øed: and therefore if it were proved, that the Apo≈øtles by divine motion were the primary Auctors of Epi≈øcopacy and not the Church; yet if it cannot appeare to be a con≈øtitution built upon perpetuall rea≈øon, and in its nature independing upon variable circum≈øtances, it may po≈ø≈øibly be changed by the Church.</p>
            <p>Here it may be demanded by what members of it ≈øelf did the univer≈øal Church abrogate the Presbyterian and in≈øtitute Epi≈øcopal Government; and what power was taken from the Presbyters by that abrogation? For an≈øwer to the≈øe demands, we mu≈øt di≈øtingni≈øh between the power given to mini≈øters, to doe ≈øome things; as to preach, baptize, ordain Pa≈øtors, excomu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, ab≈øolve, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ≈øecondly, the free exerci≈øe of tho≈øe acts, and thirdly, the regulation of the exerci≈øe of them, as to the per≈øons about whom, time when, the place where, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, decency, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To the regulation belong, 1.

As for the power, it doth
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93080:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>not appear, that any of that was taken from the Presbyters or their Colledge by the in≈øtitution of Epi≈øcopacy, if they were deprived of any part of it,<note place="margin">

               </note> and in the place of the Bi≈øhop which Could not at his plea≈øure give them, but ≈øuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed the power continuing in them. The words of the Council be the≈øe (according to the Greek Original and not their vulgar tran≈ølation) it is not lawful (≈øay the Fathers of that Synod) for the Choropi≈øcopi (Countrey, or Village Bi≈øhops) not for the Presbyters of the City to ordain Presbyters or Deacons, unle≈øs that be committed to them by the Bi≈øhop (being ab≈øent in another Dioce≈øs) by his letters. And therefore the Churches decree con≈øtituting Epi≈øcopacy, abridged the Presbyters whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dividedly, or conjunctly con≈øidered, but onely in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øe of their power. Surely it mu≈øt be beleeved, that no ordination would be made by the Apo≈øtles excelling the ordination which our Saviour celebrated, breathing upon his Apo≈øtles <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them a comi≈øsion to teach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with promi≈øe to be with them unto the worlds end, whereby the Presbyters were virtual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordained and comi≈ø≈øionated astruly as the Bi≈øhops, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore received thereby as much power as they in re≈øpect of the kind and nature; which hinders not, but that the exerci≈øe of ≈øome part of it might be taken from many of the per≈øons ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. But ≈øome perhaps may ≈øay, that Chri≈øt in that ordination or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained in the Apo≈øtles ≈øome as elder Brethren, and others as the younger, yet hence it will follow, that the kind and nature of the ordination is the ≈øame in all, (as the nature of the Father is in all his Sons) and that onely a principallity in the having and exerci≈øe of it belongs to the Bi≈øhops; which is granted. Others may ≈øay farther, that Chri≈øt in ordaining the Apo≈øtles did vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ordain ≈øome as the Sons of the Sons of the Apo≈øtles, and others as their grand-children; if this can be well proved, it will indeed evince, that the power of ordination, as well as the exerci≈øe of it, is proper to the Bi≈øhops; but until it be made clear, that this was the primary meaning and intention of Chri≈øt in that Act of ordination, and not an effect onely of a con≈øequent occa≈øional
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93080:22"/>providence of the Apo≈øtles and Churches, it is probable that the power of ordination remaineth ≈øtill in the presbyters re≈øtrained in the u≈øe by the canon of the Churches and Apo≈øtles. The members of the Church, which made the decree of Epi≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy and limited the u≈øe of the Ecle≈øia≈øtical power, in the pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, were the greater number of the presbyters them≈øelves which remained in the unity of the my≈øtical body with the greater part of the people; and the Authors of it by way of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and confirmation were the holy Apo≈øtles.

Before the≈øe Law-makers con≈øtituted Epi≈øcopacy, every ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Presbyter was to act according to the directions and rules of the Presbyterian Colledge, which was the Church Law-giver, and ≈øuperintendent of the execution, having the ≈øupreme dignity under the Mediator, and preheminence in all things properly Eccle≈øia≈øtical. What is ≈øpoken concerning the Colledge of Presbyters mu≈øt be applied proportionably to the ≈øeveral bodies of them in the Dioce≈øan, provincial, impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93080:22"/>or univer≈øal Church. The decree con≈øtituting Epi≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, took from the Colledge its high dignity and prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, and conferred it upon one, and ≈øo divided the exerci≈øe of the Legi≈ølative power among the Bi≈øhop and the Colledge, that the one might not duely u≈øe it without the other. For although the dignity and precedency of the Bi≈øhop may give more weight to his vote, yet is the Vicary authority (which cannot be ≈øeparated from Presbyters as long as they be Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters) as truly exerci≈øed in their votes, whether in deciding controver≈øies of faith, or making of Canons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as it is in the Bi≈øhops vote: Which is manife≈øt, as by many te≈øtimonies of antiquity, ≈øo by the practi≈øe of our Engli≈øh Synods, which are conformable, in the ≈øub≈øtance, to the be≈øt and mo≈øt ancient con≈øtitution of Councils. The ≈øuperintendency, which the Colledge had over the execution of all Eccle≈øia≈øtical duties and ordinances, was chiefly in the Bi≈øhop, yet ≈øo as without his Presbyters he could not regularly hear and determine Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle≈øia≈øtical cau≈øes, as before was ≈øhewed out of the fourth Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and might be further demon≈øtrated out of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and other ancient writers.</p>

            <p>Here we find Exorci≈øts and Readers (both which were in <hi>Ju≈øtin Martyrs</hi> time about the year 150) to be reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Clergy of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Reader di≈øtingui≈øhed from the Presbyter and Deacons.

               </note> It mu≈øt not be imagined that any of the≈øe, be≈øides a Presbyter and Dore-keeper, was in every Parochial Church, but only in the Cathedral or mother Church of the Dioce≈øs, and in ≈øome ≈øuch parochial Churches as were able to maintain a greater or le≈ø≈øer number of them. And therefore it ≈øeems hard to lay upon one mini≈øter in the pari≈øh Church the burthen of all the offices, to be born by him≈øelf alone, which in the Cathedral were executed by many. As to read every Lords day all the ≈øervice fir≈øt and ≈øecond, being a thing above the ≈øtrength of mo≈øt, if the Sermon be not omitted; as the Bi≈øhops and Presbyters bordering upon the times of the Apo≈øtles, with the peoples con≈øent, committed the office of reading the holy Scriptures in the Churches to men of an inferior ordination, ≈øo their ≈øucce≈ø≈øors ≈øhortly after committed the office of teaching the Catechumens to the like per≈øons, but more learned and apt to teach. Both the≈øe (as al≈øo ≈øome others) were ≈øeparated from the Laicks and de≈øtinated for the Presbytery: They were the Bi≈øhops and Presbyters Scholars, bred up by them for the high and ≈øacred mini≈øtery, and advanced thereto, if they became capable, and the Church had need of them. So that Readers and Catechi≈øers were incomplete preachers of the Go≈øpel, until by the higher and divine ordination Chri≈øt breathed upon them, giving them the Holy Gho≈øt, which made them
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93080:27"/>complete preachers; who do not perform a complete act of preaching, unle≈øs with the publi≈øhing of the text, wherein the Readers help them; they al≈øo publi≈øh an expo≈øition and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation thereupon; as <hi>Ju≈øtin Martyr</hi> did, and the ≈øucceeding ancient Fathers; who grounded their Homilies, or Sermons upon a portion of the Scriptures then read before them. One or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God is not to be made to thru≈øt another out of the Church, but reading and prayers, and preaching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ought to be ≈øo proportioned to the time appointed for them, and the ≈øtrength of them that officiate, that no nece≈ø≈øity, that may be prevented, may compel to the omi≈ø≈øion of any divine or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance that ought to be performed.

Latreia</hi> is when the Divine excellencies are the objects of the adoration, and the outward acts of adoration, are ≈øymboles of the ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion of the heart to them. The ancient Fathers did not of their own heads make a creature to ≈øupply the place of any Divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, (as men do, and may make a fellow-creature to ≈øupply the place of another, and perform ≈øuch acts of veneration to it as are due to the per≈øon repre≈øented, ≈øuch be the ≈øtatues of Emperors, and perhaps images and relicks of friends and benefactors) Nor did the Fathers offer ≈øo to couple any creature unto the Divine per≈øon of our Saviour to partake in ≈øome ≈øort of his adoration, as his apparel, when he lived on earth, was by conjunction with his body made neer to his per≈øon, even, (as many judge) to an accidental participation of his Divine adoration. It cannot be proved that it was the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church in tho≈øe times, to exhibite the external acts of divine adoration unto God, in, by, or through any created thing as co-≈øubjects or co-objects of them: in all which ca≈øes the inward adoration proper to God is in ≈øome ≈øort rendred to the co-adored creature. The intention of tho≈øe holy men was to adore the cro≈øs onely with an eccle≈øia≈øtical adoration, and ≈øo adore it for the ≈øake of Chri≈øt, and for the benefits ≈øake redounding from the cro≈øs of Chri≈øt. They ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red its excellency,<note place="margin">Concil. Con≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinop. quinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øext, Can. <hi>73.</hi>

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93080:32"/>a ≈øervice convenient to it, in order to the commending and maintenance of that its excellency: onely a created ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency was the object of this adoration. When Chri≈øtian ≈øubjects exhibite to the King acts of civil wor≈øhip or adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as kneeling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they do this from a dutiful affection to God, and a like affection of love to their prince, which is Gods Vicegerent; yet they do not perform tho≈øe individual acts of adoration to God, in, by, or through him, that is, they do not perform them to God and the King, as two di≈øtinct ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of one and the ≈øame external, and of two diver≈øe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward adorations, but terminate them onely in the King. It is true, that the Fathers many times ≈øeemed to pre≈øent the ≈øame individual acts both to God as ≈øymbols of their inward adoration of him, that is, of their affection of ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion to the divine excellencies, and al≈øo to the cro≈øs as ≈øymbols of their inward adoration of it, that is, of their affection of ≈øervice to its excellency, ≈øo uniting two inward coordinate adorations in one and the ≈øame external adoration: but whether ≈øo near a conjunction between the Divine and Eccle≈øia≈øtical adoration, (if u≈øed indeed by them) proceeded from humane frailty, or may be defended by the Holy Scriptures, or be not di≈ø≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to them, I refer to better con≈øideration.</p>
            <p>What hath been ≈øaid of the adoration of the cro≈øs, may be ea≈øily applied to the like adoration of the relicks of Saints, of the Altar or Communion-Table by bowing,<note place="margin">Chry≈øo≈øt. in 2 Cor. bom. 20. Et Ba≈øil, Liturg.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the book of the Evangels by ki≈ø≈øing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the like, which were u≈øed in the ≈øame time.

The degeneration likewi≈øe of the adoration of the Cro≈øs and Relicks added to the former brought in, in ≈øub≈øequent times, the idolatrous adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of images.</p>
            <pb n="45" facs="tcp:93080:32"/>
            <p>And all the≈øe idolatrous adorations brought in the idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous adoration of the name of Je≈øus, either prolated or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; but not before about the year 1300.<note place="margin">Conc.

Yet it is a ≈ølippery Ceremony, and made the more ≈ølippery by the glo≈øs of ≈øome of our own Divines upon <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. Whence they would prove the bowing of our knee due to that ble≈ø≈øed name Je≈øus, affirming the Fathers ≈øo to expound that Text. To ≈øpeak in ≈øober ≈øadne≈øs and truth, there is not one Father that ≈øo expounds it, although you produce the Catalogue of the Fathers to ≈øweet and holy <hi>Bernard.</hi> There is not one Orthodox Author in all the length of that Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of Fathers, who ≈øpeaks of any adoration given or to be given or exhibited to that mo≈øt ≈øweet name Je≈øus. The places produced by ≈øome late School-men out of the Fathers to make good their novel expo≈øition of that place in the Epi≈øtle of the <hi>Philippians,</hi> (which our men believed, and were thereby decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) have in them very ≈ømall appearance of proof, and nothing truth, as the in≈øpection of the places them≈øelves, (and e≈øpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if compared with other plainer places of the ≈øame authors) will manife≈øtly di≈øcover. All the latter School-men maintain that adoration of the good name Je≈øus, whether ≈øpoken or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten but all have not the bra≈øen Foreheads to produce the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers as Patrons of it, or to expound the fore≈øaid text to prove it a duty. Let <hi>Va≈øques</hi> a Learned Je≈øuite be heard;<note place="margin">

And a little after he faith, out of this place it is not ≈øufficiently proved, that any honour (no not by accident) is to be exhibited to the word [Je≈øus] writen or ≈øpoken, as to an image with its prototype. Therefore although there may be an innocency in tho≈øe adorations u≈øed in the right manner and ≈øen≈øe, yet it is hardly pre≈øerved, (I had almo≈øt ≈øaid morally impo≈ø≈øible) by the vulgar: it is ≈øo ea≈øie a lap≈øe from the u≈øe of one of them to fall to the u≈øe of the re≈øt, and then to the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93080:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>abu≈øe of every of them: For tho≈øe Eccle≈øia≈øtical adorations of the altar, Evangels and the name Je≈øus are u≈øed mo≈øtly in the time of divine ≈øervice, when the like external acts of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration are exhibited to God, which near conjunction in time and place, between the one adoration and the other, and the beholding the ≈øame acts of wor≈øhip to be done to God and a ≈øacred thing, doth puzzle the ignorant and unwary that either his zeal is as much to the creatures adoration, as to the Creators; or mingles in his mind both the adorations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the be≈øt is deba≈øed and corrupted.</p>
            <p>Some may ≈øay, may we not bow to God, and kneel to him at the altar, without danger? It is ≈øoon an≈øwered; That with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt we may, and mu≈øt do ≈øo, and in ≈øo doing, our mind doth not intend the altar, as the object of our bowing: The danger is in bowing to the altar, for then we make it the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to which we bow.</p>
            <p>It may be demanded if the Magi≈øtrate make the naming of the name Je≈øus, the name of the Saviour of the world, to be a ≈øign when, in the divine ≈øervice, we mu≈øt bow to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of the Lord Je≈øus, God and man, and not to the name Je≈øus, may we not without danger ≈øo do? I an≈øwer, fir≈øt, That it is our duty to bow our hearts, and al≈øo in convenient time and place, to bow our bodies to the man Je≈øus Chri≈øt, in the unity of the divine per≈øon. And this is intended in <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. Secondly, to bow our bodies at the naming of the name of Je≈øus is no duty that we are bound unto. It is indifferent then to bow or not to bow, as it is at the naming of the name of Chri≈øt. Thirdly, if the magi≈øtrate command us either at the naming of the name Je≈øus, or at the naming of the name Chri≈øt in the divine ≈øervice, to wor≈øhip Chri≈øt, God and man, by bowing unto him, and not intending the name [Je≈øus] or [Chri≈øt] as an object of our bowing, it is our duty to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey our Superiours command. Fourthly, from the bowing [at] the name the vulgar ea≈øily fall to the bowing [to] the name.</p>
            <p>The≈øe adorations of the Cro≈øs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> inward and outward may not be counted divine or properly and of their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, religious, becau≈øe no rule of true religion doth require
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93080:33"/>them, but they are properly Eccle≈øia≈øtical, becau≈øe the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches did ≈øometime create them; and as things Eccle≈øia≈øtical, and things any way made pertinent to religion, are counted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious things, ≈øo may the≈øe adorations be accidentally called religious. There is not that kind and degree of excellency in the Cro≈øs, Communion-Table, or name Je≈øus, or in any ≈øuch ≈øacred thing, which may in proper ≈øen≈øe merit and require that mental regard from us, which ≈øhould of right be te≈øtified by tho≈øe acts of wor≈øhip. Neither do we find that the Churches acknowledged any obligation upon them, to make any Canon requiring tho≈øe adorations, but onely, as circum≈øtances then were, a congruity to command their u≈øe: under which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and judgement of the Church, individual per≈øons were to acknowledge tho≈øe ≈øacred things worthy tho≈øe honours. Wherefore if it plea≈øe our Superiors to continue the u≈øe of the≈øe Ceremonies, which are ≈øo ea≈øily abu≈øed, it will be very nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øtate and determine the right u≈øe of them, and to point at the dangers to be avoided, and to command that the cautions be at ≈øet times read in the Churches, that none may erre for want of knowledge, or by forgetfulne≈øs.</p>
            <p>The di≈øcreet followers of the holy ancient Fathers of the Church are worthy commendation, but their apes are ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous. To ≈øow the foul raggs of ≈øome late ≈ølovenly School-men to the comely garment of our Church (as the mi≈øinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters of the text in <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. have attempted) is an act di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful to the authors, derogating from the honour and dignity of our dear Mother and introductory of unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble adorations, being pretended to be commanded by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God. For, if it be once obtained that the adoration u≈øed to the name Je≈øus is of divine in≈øtitution, it will by the nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øity of like rea≈øon follow, that the bowing to the cro≈øs and the Communion-Table, and e≈øpecially, to the holy bread and wine, is a duty which of divine right doth belong unto them.</p>

            <p>Now if the Presbyterian Government was uneffectuall for the pre≈øerving of peace among the mo≈øt godly, and con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the mo≈øt addicted to peace, who can expect it ≈øhould be effectuall to re≈øtore union and peace, and to pre≈øerve it in Churches too full of pollutions and ≈øtaines, very much dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated from the holine≈øs of the Apo≈øtolicall times? It ≈øeems a de≈øperate and prepo≈øterous cour≈øe, to u≈øe that as a ≈øoveraigne Antidote in our time, which had the effect of a Poy≈øon upon the Churches in the Apo≈øties time. A hurnt Child dreads the fire; and ≈øhould not the weaker members of the body dread the fire, that burnt the ≈øtronge≈øt and be≈øt able to re≈øi≈øt its force? Seeing the remainder of naturall corruption in the mo≈øt holy Churches drew the Poy≈øon of Sci≈øme from the Presbyterian forme of government, we cannot, without high pre≈øumption, think that the far higher degrees of ≈øin remaining in us, will be idle, &amp; ≈øuffer grace to make of it an Antidote again≈øt Schi≈øme. Mountebanks are ≈øeen ≈øometime to heal by improper Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, where the ≈øtrength of nature, and the concurrence of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93080:38"/>≈øome other ≈øecret cau≈øes do performe the cure, and not the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Phy≈øick. So may the Presbyterian government have in ≈øome place the credit of healing Schi≈ømes &amp; maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peace, when in very truth tho≈øe good effects proceed from the confluence of other cau≈øes, and not from the aptne≈øs of that government to effect them: For it ≈øeems incredible that it ≈øhould have in it an aptne≈øs to keep us in peace, that had in it an ineptitude to keep the mo≈øt peaceably di≈øpo≈øed Apo≈øtolick Chri≈øtians in unity and peace. Whence we may conclude, that although the ancient Epi≈øcopacy be in its nature changeable, as being of the Churches, and by con≈øequence of humane con≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, yet morally and practically it may not be abrogated without dammage to the Church; which will a≈ø≈øuredly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, if ≈øome accidentall benigne influences of ≈øome other cau≈øes do not for ≈øome time hinder its birth.</p>
            <p>I am very apt to believe, that the Churches, which ≈øeem to u≈øe the Presbyterian government, never intended by any Law, de≈øerving the proper name of a Law, to ≈øettle the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Presbytery in their Churches, whence the ≈øad Schi≈ømes aro≈øe in the primitive times; much le≈øs to abrogate the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Epi≈øcopacy, which in the judgment of the be≈øt Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and of the Apo≈øtles, is the healer of Schi≈ømes, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerver of peace: But that they intended (as they had good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon) to abrogate the corrupted Hierarchy, with the multitude of its oppre≈ø≈øing attendants, and (as nece≈ø≈øity compelled them) ≈øeemingly to ≈øu≈øpend their reception of the ancient Epi≈øcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but in very deed receiving in ≈øome hidden ≈øort the ≈øub≈øtance of it, ≈øecretly giving that Authority to the moderator of the Colledge of Presbyters, which tantamounts the Authority of the ancient Bi≈øhops. This was done by them in their Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, out of the Gulfe of the Babyloni≈øh Idolatry and Haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øies, when the ≈øtate of per≈øons and Circum≈øtances would not permit them directly and manife≈øtly to ≈øet up the ancient Epi≈øcopacy, but covertly and cloathed with the apparel of Pre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery; Becau≈øe the appearing of it in its native cloathing ≈øeemed to threaten an extreme danger of returning again to Idolatrous <hi>Babylon.</hi> Thus when two duties became incon≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtent, the keeping out of Idolatry, and the open and manife≈øt
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93080:39"/>u≈øe of an Ordinance inferior to the maintenance of the purity of Gods wor≈øhip; they did, as it was their duty, ≈øo far forbear the open u≈øe of Epi≈øcopacy as ≈øeemed needfull, that they might pre≈øerve the truth and ≈øincerity of the wor≈øhip of God. I know many writers are of another mind, but the intentions of Churches are better ≈øeen in the cau≈øes of their actions, and the managing of them, then in the letter of a Law, or in the ≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative opinions of private per≈øons.</p>
            <p>Some think the pre≈øent condition of our Church, to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt the ≈øame with the ≈øtate of tho≈øe Churches, when they fir≈øt began their Reformation, and therefore that we ≈øtand in need of the ≈øame cure under the habit of the Presbyterian Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Surely the≈øe are much deceived; fir≈øt, in their opinion of our pre≈øent ≈øtate; ≈øecondly, in the ≈øequele, if our ca≈øe were like theirs: for, when we were like them in departing from <hi>Babylon,</hi> we were unlike them in many other re≈øpects, and needed not the habit of Presbyters, but fall to purge the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Epi≈øcopacy from as many of the foul excre≈øcencies which the ≈øins of men made to grow to it, as the condition of that time would permit, whereby our Church kept more uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the primitive Churches, and by the ble≈ø≈øing of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our endevour, obtained more mea≈øure of the Heavenly light, and of the power of Godline≈øs in peace, and that for a longer time, then any part of tho≈øe Churches attained unto, which were nece≈øsitated to ≈øhrowd them≈øelves under another habit of Government. This I ≈øay not any way to di≈øparage any other Church of Chri≈øt, (whom I honour and pray for from my heart) or to a≈øcribe any thing to our own wi≈ødome and providence, but to honour and glorifie the grace of God for his great mercies to our Church, and to defend her honour again≈øt the mi≈øtakes of ≈øome.</p>
            <p>But now our condition is changed our ≈øins have brought us to mi≈øery, the light and glory of our Church is turned to dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, confu≈øion, and contempt; from which (notwith≈øtanding our unworthine≈øs) Gods infinite mercy (which hath mo≈øt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiou≈øly re≈øtored our Soveraign Lord the King unto his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and Subjects) will be plea≈øed, I tru≈øt, to deliver us, and to beautifie our Church with the primitive Apo≈øtolicall Epi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy,

Secondly, That God hath appointed the powers civil and Eccle≈øia≈øticall in his ≈øtead to determine Eccle≈øia≈øticall contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øies, and to make Eccle≈øia≈øticall Ordinances, from who≈øe judgment there is no appeal but only to God by prayer.

            <p>And from the≈øe con≈øiderations good men will infer that it is good for them, and that it is their duty both for the ≈øake of Gods Authority, for good order ≈øake, and for Charity and peace ≈øake, &amp; out of a Con≈øcientious regard to the higher pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to acquie≈øce in their determinations, and to de≈øi≈øt from oppo≈øing their private opinion to the publick judgment, and pur≈øuing their private intere≈øt to the prejudice of publick peace and Charity.

            <p>Here ≈øome doubts are rai≈øed which by divers are diver≈øely re≈øolved. As whether Chri≈øt did ordaine the Apo≈øtles in the fir≈øt place Presbyters, and after that Bi≈øhops? and if ≈øo, when was this done? or if it be ≈øaid that Chri≈øt made them Apo≈øtles, Presbyters and Bi≈øhops, in one and the ≈øame Ordination, how can it be proved that Chri≈øt gave the Apo≈øtles the powers now proper to Bi≈øhops, not only as they were extraordinary Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, but al≈øo as they were to have ≈øucce≈ø≈øors; and not rather that Chri≈øt re≈øerved tho≈øe powers as they were to be conveyed by ≈øucce≈ø≈øion to be given in a more convenient time? it is
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93080:41"/>generally acknowledged that Presbyters were vertually or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained when the Apo≈øtles were ordained. If Chri≈øt made the Apo≈øtles both Presbyters and Bi≈øhops in one Ordination, how dur≈øt the Church alter our Saviours Ordinance, as to ordain them by two actuall Ordinations whom He Him≈øelf had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained in one virtuall Ordination? to ≈øay that our ble≈ø≈øed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ordained the Apo≈øtles fir≈øt Presbyters, and afterwards Bi≈øhops, is to affirm that which the Evangeli≈øts do not menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

            <p>I confe≈øs that I did ≈øometime begin to ≈øu≈øpect, that when the Roman Court had determined ordination to be a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment properly ≈øo called, as bapti≈øm, and in≈øtituted by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, they put in tho≈øe words in the ≈øolemnity of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the better confirmation and propagation of their new opinion; but con≈øidering the rea≈øons afore≈øaid, and e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially that the ble≈ø≈øed Reformers of our Church have retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ≈øame words, and nothing doubting but that in ≈øo doing they did not favour the popi≈øh opinion, but were per≈øwaded they did therein follow their pattern, which was the u≈øage of the Primitive Church, I rejected that conceit and ≈øu≈øpition.</p>
            <p>The fir≈øt Author that I can remember to have read, more expre≈ø≈øely intimating the ≈øaid words of benediction to be u≈øed in the ordination of Presbyters, is our Country-man <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Hale,</hi> in the≈øe words;<note place="margin">Summ. part. <hi>4.</hi> q. <hi>21.</hi> mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>br. <hi>4.</hi>

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93080:44"/>taking away the power and raign of ≈øin, which is done by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øed grace, which having removed the ≈øpiritual darkne≈øs and death, illuminates the ≈øoul, and makes it alive to God.

            <p>The Fathers do often apply tho≈øe words in St. <hi>John</hi> now frequently remembred, and the like in <hi>Matth.</hi> ch. 16. and chap. 18. to the act of reconciling Paenitents to God and the Church, and much oftner then they do to any other kind of the mini≈øterial loo≈øing or remi≈ø≈øion, and they had good rea≈øons moving them ≈øo to do. For, fir≈øt, Haereticks began in the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Century to deny that Chri≈øt left any mini≈øterial power in his Church for the remi≈ø≈øion of any great ≈øin committed after bapti≈øm; and this Here≈øie was revived by <hi>Novatian</hi> and <hi>Novatus</hi> in the third Century, and quickned by the Donati≈øts in the fourth Century. Again≈øt which, the Orthodox Pa≈øtors of the Church u≈øed tho≈øe places of Scripture, to prove that the power of reconciling ≈øuch Penitents was given to the Church of Chri≈øt. Secondly, the zeal of the people in the Primitive Times, and the encouragements of the Mini≈øters, and after, the Canons of the Church inclined the people to make confe≈ø≈øion of their ≈øecret enormities to the Church or Pa≈øtors (not becau≈øe nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øalvation, but becau≈øe it was found very profitable as the times and per≈øons were then qualified,) and publick offendors were brought to publick repentance, and (this being duely performed) were publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reconciled to God and his Church. The≈øe things being ≈øo frequent and ≈øolemn, yet very irk≈øome and grievous to fle≈øh and blood, it was very nece≈ø≈øary for the Fathers of the Church to put the people dayly in mind of the benefit of tho≈øe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øions and penitence, and the nece≈ø≈øity of both as to ≈øcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous offences in order to a publick reconciliation, which they could not otherwi≈øe do better then by making u≈øe of tho≈øe places of Scripture for the Demon≈øtration and proof of the peoples Duty, and the certainty and comfort of their reconciliation.</p>
            <pb n="69" facs="tcp:93080:44"/>
            <p>None of tho≈øe holy Pa≈øtors denyed the mini≈øterial power of remi≈ø≈øion or loo≈ø≈øing to be exerci≈øed in the other mini≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial offices, in≈øtituted as the means which God would ble≈øs (if not abu≈øed) for the begetting and increa≈øing of ≈øaving grace.

               <hi>Peter</hi> (≈øaith <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bro≈øe</hi>) did not alone receive the ≈øheep, but received them with us, and we received them with him. Chri≈øt in the Apo≈øtles gave unto all Pa≈øtors the power of ordaining Pa≈øtors; becau≈øe he gave them the Keyes to be conveyed to ≈øucce≈ø≈øors. But the power of appointing who among the Presbyters ≈øhould exerci≈øe them, and how, and who among them ≈øhould be governours of the u≈øe of the Keyes, was not conveyed with the Keyes to all Pa≈øtors in the Apo≈øtolical ordination; becau≈øe it was pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the extraordinary office of the Apo≈øtles, either to leave that to the wi≈ødome of the Church and ordinary Pa≈øtors to order, or to ≈øettle it in one Presbyter a≈ø≈øi≈øted with the Colledge of Presbyters, or otherwi≈øe, as the Holy Gho≈øt ≈øhould guide them. We may not think that our Saviour did give unto every Presbyter power to ordain, preach, admini≈øter the Sacraments, excommunicate, or ab≈øolve, at his own will and plea≈øure, without any appointment of a flock, or calling him to account of his Steward≈øhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for this is again≈øt the light of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93080:46"/>nature, unle≈øs God had given unto every Presbyter wi≈ødome and a will which could not erre in the orderly u≈øe of the Keyes, as he gave unto the Apo≈øtles; without which extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary grace the hou≈øe of God in that ca≈øe had been full of di≈øorder and confu≈øion, which Chri≈øt would not permit.</p>
            <p>If the power of di≈øpo≈øing and governing the act of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and the exerci≈øe of the acts of binding and loo≈øing had been given to the body of the Presbyters by our Saviour, the Apo≈øtles and univer≈øal Church had never deprived the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of that authority: Wherefore as the fir≈øt planting of the Chri≈øtian Churches was proper to the Apo≈øtles, ≈øo the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtituting of the form of government, and the governors of the exerci≈øe of the acts of ordination, and the Keyes was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted onely to their tru≈øt. And it was very congruous that Chri≈øt would not determine the form of the government of his Church and Pa≈øtors thereof before his a≈øcention into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the taking full po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of his government and Kingdome at the right hand of his Father.</p>
            <p>The Apo≈øtles planted the Churches after this manner: When God had ble≈ø≈øed their mini≈øtery in Cities and con≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Towns, and in the Country adjacent, in the conver≈øion of many to God, they con≈øtituted one congregation or Church of all the converts in that City or good Town and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try about it, So ordering Eccle≈øia≈øtical Corporations as might, as much as could be, be≈øt agree with the civil corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and their divi≈øion. For the feeding of which Church they ordained Pa≈øtors, and tho≈øe many in every City-Church,<note place="margin">Ubi e≈øt Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øia ni≈øi ubi vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga &amp; gratia floret ≈øacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talis. <hi>Ambro≈ø.</hi> de <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaac</hi> &amp; anima c. <hi>7.</hi> Es <hi>Hier.</hi> contra Lucifer.

But within a ≈øhort time, when Chri≈øtianity was much ≈øpread in ≈øeveral Nations, and many City-Churches were grown populous, ≈øo that they had many le≈ø≈øer Churches under them; and the Apo≈øtles and their Vicegerents could be pre≈øent but in very few in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of the far greater number which wanted their ≈øociety, the Colledges in the≈øe began to be divided among them≈øelves, and to divide the Churches, which cau≈øed the Apo≈øtles guided
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:93080:47"/>thereto by the Spirit of Chri≈øt to con≈øent to a change of the government which was by the Colledges (bodies without a head, and ≈øo apt to ≈øwerve in ruling populous Churches) into a pre≈øident in every Church cho≈øen out of the Pa≈øtors, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Colledge of the City and be≈øt Presbyters as his Senate and Coun≈øellors. And then both the Apo≈øtles and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeli≈øts, or Apo≈øtolical helpers, which were extraordinary Bi≈øhops, become ordinary Bi≈øhops to be ≈øucceded by others. And the≈øe la≈øt were like our Arch-bi≈øhops, having many Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhops under them, as <hi>Titus</hi> in <hi>Creet, &amp;c.</hi> and the Apo≈øtles were like our Primates but of higher authority, and having more Arch-bi≈øhops under them.

            <p>Unto the impo≈øition of hands, benediction and prayers (which were of the e≈ø≈øence of the ordinations of Bi≈øhops and Presbyters) many Ceremonies were in time added, ≈øome ≈øooner, ≈øome later, which ≈øerved to make a clearer mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øtation of the Eccle≈øia≈øtical powers received in and by them; which additional Ceremonies in time became occa≈øions of foul mi≈øtakes: Some making the additions to be the e≈ø≈øence of the ordinations, or part thereof; other multiplying the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Apo≈øtles according to the diver≈øity of kinds of the powers, which they in very deed received, but in one or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, although iterated for ≈øome ≈øpecial rea≈øons.</p>

            <p>The Schoolmen found the Laicks impower'd by commi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion from <hi>Rome, &amp;c.</hi> to excommunicate: Hence they di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øh between the power of the Order and the power of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈ødiction. We gather from the holy Scriptures and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Primitive Church, that excommunication was ordained to be a mean to bring a per≈øon, guilty of ≈øome ≈øcandalous ≈øin committed after Bapti≈øm, to the degree of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and humiliation; meet fir≈øt, to receive pardon of ≈øin through faith in Chri≈øts blood. Secondly, to ≈øatisfie and edifie the Church by good example in proportion to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence given and harme done by his bad example. Thirdly, to take away the evil propen≈øity, the skars and blots made in the Soul by the ≈øin committed, and to re≈øtore the offender to the degree of purity of Soul, and con≈øequently of communion with God, and of Gods love to him which he enjoyed before his fall; which are obtained when God is glorified and plea≈øed by the humiliation in proportion to the di≈øhonour done to God, and the divine di≈øplea≈øure incurred by ≈øin. Fourthly, to receive more ≈øtrength to make the penitent able to ≈øtand, and avoid the like fall in time to come.

Whereby we under≈øtand the power of juri≈ødi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, in this ≈øen≈øe as oppo≈øed to the power of order, to be the gift neither of Chri≈øt nor of his Apo≈øtles. If the Church gave this power, it was a corrupt Church that gave it, for by this ordinance of man the ordinance of Chri≈øt is made void; The ordinance of man, is exalted above the ordinance of Chri≈øt; for the excommunication which is Chri≈øts ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance may be executed by the Presbyter (in ≈øubordination to the Bi≈øhop, but) without his Commi≈ø≈øion; the humane ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication is made peculiar to the Bi≈øhop the chief of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer in the Church, to be executed by him≈øelf or ≈øome other by his commi≈ø≈øion.

            <p>It is the duty of the lay Chri≈øtian magi≈øtrate to over≈øee, facilitate and corroborate the due execution of the ≈øpiritual cen≈øure of excommunication performed by Bi≈øhops princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally and Presbyters ≈øubordinately: but if any ask, whether he may not excommunicate either by him≈øelf or by a ≈øub≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute? although the an≈øwer is already given in the premi≈øes, yet I ≈øay, he may do ≈øo, and if he have the gift, may preach in publick, and mini≈øter the holy Sacraments as lawfully as the 250 per≈øons ≈øpoken of in the ≈øixteenth chap. of <hi>Numbers,</hi> took cen≈øer and offered incen≈øe,<note place="margin">2 Chron. <hi>c.</hi> 27.</note> and as lawfully as King <hi>Uzziah</hi> did the like: And as to the curing of the Lepro≈øy of the ≈øoul, he may expect the like ≈øucce≈øs as <hi>Naaman</hi> would have had as to the healing of the Lepro≈øy of his body,<note place="margin">2 King. <hi>c.</hi> 5.</note> if he had wa≈øhed him≈øelf in any other river then <hi>Jordan,</hi> wherein the Prophet commanded him to wa≈øh him≈øelf in order to his clean≈øing.</p>
            <p>The Kings Proclamation prevaileth more with many to leave their ≈øcandalous vices and to live ≈øoberly, then the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of the be≈øt Bi≈øhops and Presbyters u≈øually do with mo≈øt men: Will any therefore conclude that the Proclamation of the King, is an effectual means for the infu≈øion of Gods ≈øaving grace, as well as the preaching of the Go≈øpel by them that are lawfully called to that ≈øacred work? the Chri≈øtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈øtrates

We live by faith, and not by ≈øen≈øe.</p>
            <p>The Independent congregations blame the reverend Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhops for ≈øome mi≈øcarriages about the heavy cen≈øure of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, and exclaim both again≈øt them, and again≈øt Presbyters for being more zealous for ceremonies, then for the due execution of our function in the maine offices thereof, and for the power of godline≈øs. As for the abu≈øe of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, the blame was to have been imputed unto others, and not to the Bi≈øhops. And to ≈øay the very truth, in this matter of excommunication, the Canons of our Church are defective and require amendment, which perhaps ≈øome invincible hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances would not permit to be done in times pa≈øt. As for the mi≈øplacing of the intention of our zeal; Fir≈øt, as being my ≈øelf a Presbyter, although one of the meane≈øt, I mu≈øt an≈øwer for my ≈øelf, that although (it may be) no man will or can condemn me, yet truely I cannot ju≈øtifie my ≈øelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the judgment ≈øeat of Almighty God, but mu≈øt make my earne≈øt ≈øupplication for mercy to my judge. I fear lea≈øt any ≈øoul mi≈øcarry, or mi≈øcarried through my default, that his blood ≈øhould be required at my hands; And therefore I tremble when I con≈øider what account I am to give of my Steward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip. And now having knowledge and experience of the mo≈øt heavy weight of this ≈øacred vocation, and the great propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øity of our nature, ≈øtrengthened by manifold temptations, unto unfaithfulne≈øs therein, if I were now to enter into it, the con≈øcience of my weakne≈øs and fear of mi≈øcarriage would cau≈øe me to decline it, but being long ≈øince entred, woe
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:93080:50"/>unto me if I preach not the Go≈øpel; and I will not be di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged having the power and mercy of God in whom I tru≈øt to be my ≈øtrength and comfort. I de≈øire all good men, as charitably to cen≈øure us, ≈øo to pray earne≈øtly to God for us, that the great afflictions which we have ≈øuffered may be ≈øan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified to us, that remembring the afflictions and mi≈øeries, the Wormwood and the Gall, our ≈øouls may be humbled in us, and that the extraordinary deliverance and ble≈ø≈øings may entirely ingage our hearts to ≈øerve the Lord with all diligence and faithfulne≈øs in the holy mini≈øtery, and to feed the flock of God, taking the over≈øight thereof not by con≈øtraint but willingly, not for filthy Lucre (a pe≈øtilence in the Church) but of a ready mind, neither being Lords over Gods Heritage (≈øo unbecoming the me≈ø≈øengers of the Lamb of God, who wa≈øhed his Di≈øciples feet,) but being examples to the flock of ≈øobriety, humility, meekne≈øs, Chri≈øtian bounty to the poor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it becomes not good men to cen≈øure us for u≈øing tho≈øe Rites and Ceremonies, which we are per≈øwaded not to be prohibited by Gods Law, and both they and we do ≈øurely know to be commanded to be u≈øed by mans Law duely made, which is Gods ordinance, to which we mu≈øt be ≈øubject for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience ≈øake. We pity the tender con≈øcience which cannot without offence either obey or di≈øobey that ordinance. And where any of a good life is ≈øeen to have that tenderne≈øs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the malignity of pride, and labour to propagate it and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Church, the piety and di≈øcretion of the Bi≈øhop will u≈øe him gently, in≈øtruct him, pray for him, waite patiently for his amendment, and, unle≈ø≈øe the example of the party is ≈øeen to corrupt the ≈øound, will hardly be drawn to go beyond a threatning, becau≈øe puni≈øhment to a man of that temper, ≈øeems rather to be an addition of mi≈øery to him, then whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øome Phy≈øick meet to cure him.</p>
            <p>If any will attempt to be Authors of Combinations, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort, by ≈øhew of multitudes and by tumults, the alteration or abrogation of any part of the e≈øtabli≈øhed laws Civil or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle≈øia≈øtical, they will thereby evidently manife≈øt them≈øelves to be but meer pretenders to a tender con≈øcience and power of godline≈øs; for they that labour to extort a part, if they
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:93080:50"/>prevaile, mu≈øt have the whole in their power. And can they that attempt ≈øo great robbery love God, and the power of Godline≈øs? By this cur≈øed fruit we know the≈øe to be mo≈øt vile Hypocrites. Let no good people be deceived by their ≈øheeps cloathing; look upon this bitter fruit, and you ≈øee that they are within but greedy and ravening Wolves:<note place="margin">Contra epi≈øt.

               </note> God deliver us from them, and deliver them from the wickedne≈øs of their hearts and wayes: but leaving the≈øe I proceed. It is very pertinent to the matter in hand to ≈øpeak of reordination; but becau≈øe this ≈øubject is two large, I will onely ≈øay thus much, that St. <hi>Aug.</hi> and the Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally all antiquity are again≈øt reordination, as well as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt rebaptization, both truely ≈øo called. In ca≈øes of doubt whether one were truely bapti≈øed or truely ordained, it was never accounted a rebaptization to bapti≈øe the one, or reor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to ordain the other. The ordination of a Presbyter by Presbyters without Commi≈ø≈øion from a Bi≈øhop; was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes judged of dubious validity at the lea≈øt. Some ≈øo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained in foreine Churches were not rejected by the Bi≈øhops of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> I believe, becau≈øe they thought that to judge of the fact of another Church in matter of no greater moment would not tend to ≈øtrengthen unity between the Churches, but rather to dimini≈øh and weaken it; Or, it may be, they did not admit them, as certainly knowing them to be ≈øo ordained, but as charitably believing they had been ordained by a Bi≈øhop, for charity covereth the multitude of ≈øins: a doubtful ordination e≈øtabli≈øhed in all the parts of it, by the publick con≈øent and authority of a Church is far more tolerable, then the like ordination celebrated in all the parts of it, without and again≈øt the legal con≈øent and authority of the Church. For in this la≈øt ca≈øe, many are doubtful of the validity of Bapti≈øm, and the other divine ordinances admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øtred by them that were ≈øo ordained. But the Higher power partly hath, and in convenient time will remove all ≈øuch doubts to the full ≈øatisfaction of all good men. I have already exceeded my intended brevity. I will ≈øay no more, but de≈øire the candid reader to believe that I have not maintained E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi≈øcopacy to be an in≈øtitution of Chri≈øt by the Apo≈øtles, and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:93080:51"/>not an in≈øtitution of Chri≈øt in the Apo≈øtles (as ≈øome hold, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by many fair probabilities) out of a ≈øpirit of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; but becau≈øe the ≈øentence cho≈øen by me ≈øeems to be ≈øubject to le≈øs difficulties, and more agreeable to the ancient pa≈øtoral and Epi≈øcopal ordinations which be received and u≈øed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and e≈øpecially becau≈øe it doth more incline and conduce to moderation.
